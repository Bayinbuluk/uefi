Processor compatibility
UEFI supports processor architectures that are 32-bit or higher. However, only processors with a little-endian mode are supported.[16]: section 1.9.1  
The UEFI specification, version 2.11, 
has official documentation for the following processor architectures:[16]: section 3.5.1.1 

x86 (IA-32, x86-64)
Itanium (IA-64)
ARM (AArch32, AArch64)
RISC-V (32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit)
LoongArch (32-bit, 64-bit)
Unofficial UEFI support is under development for POWERPC64 by implementing TianoCore on top of OPAL,[17] the OpenPOWER abstraction layer, running in little-endian mode.[18] For MIPS, there also exists an unofficial project[19][20]
